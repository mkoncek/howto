=== Patching

==== Annotation removal

Some Java packages use annotations which are not needed for their proper
function. These often include annotations for static code analysis, like
`@SuppressFBWarnings`. While most cases can be patched out using patches or
using `sed`, annotations can span multiple lines and can contain nested strings
with variable content. For this situation `javapackages-extra` package contains
macro which can be used to remove annotations from Java sources. It is used as
follows:

    %java_remove_annotations src -n SuppressFBWarnings

See the manual page of <<_java_remove_annotations, `%java_remove_annotations`>> for more details.
